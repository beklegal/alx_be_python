# Define the variables
principal = 1000      # principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05           # annual interest rate as a decimal (5%)
time = 3              # time in years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
